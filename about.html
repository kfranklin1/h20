    <p.\> Myself and my group of friends were out looking for A good time.
          There were not any places for teens to hang out.
          So One friday evening Katron Suggested we creat our own hang out.
    <p>   Thats when H20 was Founded. Tyra, Erriona and Myself worked day and night.
          Creating the perfect Music Menu and Entertainment for the Beest Teen Pub In Town.
    
     <p>  Now with all our hard work coming together Perfectly We now have the Hottest Teen
         Pub and grill around. The H20 Pub And Grill.
